	I will be graduating by Spring '21, and I am looking for postdocs and any job opportunities in Cognitive Psychology / Machine Learning & AI / Computer Vision
 

I am a 5th year PhD student in the Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences, Johns Hopkins University. I work primarily with [Dr. Jon Flombaum](https://pbs.jhu.edu/directory/jonathan-flombaum/), and am currently collaborating with [Dr. Ian Phillips](https://www.ianbphillips.com) for my dissertation. My dissertation work is on how we represent and process time in our mind. In the past, I have worked on understanding the mechanisms behind the limitations of our visual cognition using eye tracking and computational modelling.

In addition, I also work on comics. I am currently collaborating with [Dr. Neil Cohn](http://www.visuallanguagelab.com/about.html) where I am investigating whether we process visual narratives based on narrative syntax trees using computational models in natural language processing.

I am very interested in building computational models to study how human cognition works. I try to keep up with the research in Machine Learning / Deep Learning community to this end. Some of the issues that I deeply care about are the symbolic vs. distributed representations, and their role in cognition.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions regarding my research. I am currently located at

Ames 150,
Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences,
3400 N. Charles Street,
Baltimore,
MD - 21218, USA.
