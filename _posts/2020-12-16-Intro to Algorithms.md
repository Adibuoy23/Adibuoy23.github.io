<p class="message">
Recently, I have been spending some time learning about algorithms and data structures. These are particularly useful if you want to:
</p>
 * Prepare for interviews with Google, FB, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon etc.
 * Write optimal code. [for eg: reducing complexity from O(n) to O(log n)]
 * Learn Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

Here is the [github repo](https://github.com/Adibuoy23/Algorithms/)
