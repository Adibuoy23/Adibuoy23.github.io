I'm trying something new, shifting from vanilla [html5up](https://html5up.net/) to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). This helps in a few areas: one is dynamic content updates, with the static blog-like format that Jekyll provides, along with a greater usage of markdown in the whole rendering process. My apologies if the website is less user-friendly for a while until I get all the kinks sorted out.

I'm currently building on the [Minimal mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) based on [Li Zeng's](https://zenglix.github.io/personal_website/), and [Dr. Kartheik Iyer](https://kartheikiyer.github.io)
