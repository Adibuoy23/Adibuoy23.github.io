I am excited to share my research on analyzing visual narratives using computational psycholinguistics approaches. Do we group temporal events according to an underlying structure? Take reading comprehension task for example. Evidence from psycholinguistics shows that an underlying syntax structure is influencing our reading comprehension. Words that violate syntax structure require more processing. This hints at the possibility of grouping temporal events in time. Is this ability to group temporal events a general purpose mechanism? If yes, can it be applied to other cognitive processes as well? In this talk, I explore if our visual narrative comprehension is structured like spoken language? I demonstrate that we can use existing computational psycholingustics tools to study this question. This is a collaboration with Neil Cohn, PhD. I am looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this project!
