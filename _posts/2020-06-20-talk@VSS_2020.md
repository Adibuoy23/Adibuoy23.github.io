I am excited to share my research on how space and time dissociate in the construction of a visual moment. This work - in collaboration with Ian Phillips and my advisor Jon Flombaum - suggests that a moment in our visual experience is a snapshot that is stitched together from different moments in time across the visual field. I am looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this!
