Our experience of passage of time varies with the situation that we are in. For example, we report time being slowed down in near death experiences. In the cognitive psychology literature, this phenomenon is referred to as the subjective expansion of time. I along with Ian Phillips &amp;amp; Jon Flombaum show that the subjective expansion of time happens in our immediate memory, and not in our perceptual experience. In other words, these results suggest that our experience of time does not change in different situations. Instead, the way we remember how long those situations lasted for is distorted. I am looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this!

&lt;/p&gt;

I am excited to share my research on how space and time dissociate in the construction of a visual moment. This work - in collaboration with Ian Phillips and my advisor Jon Flombaum - suggests that a moment in our visual experience is a snapshot that is stitched together from different moments in time across the visual field. I am looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this!
