I am excited to share my research on analyzing visual narratives using computational psycholinguistics approaches. Do we group temporal events according to an underlying structure? Take reading comprehension task for example. Evidence from psycholinguistics shows that an underlying syntax structure is influencing our reading comprehension. Words that violate syntax structure require more processing. This hints at the possibility of grouping temporal events in time. Is this ability to group temporal events a general purpose mechanism? If yes, can it be applied to other cognitive processes as well? In this talk, I explore if our visual narrative comprehension is structured like spoken language? I demonstrate that we can use existing computational psycholingustics tools to study this question. This is a collaboration with Neil Cohn, PhD. I am looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this project!

Our experience of passage of time varies with the situation that we are in. For example, we report time being slowed down in near death experiences. In the cognitive psychology literature, this phenomenon is referred to as the subjective expansion of time. I along with Ian Phillips &amp;amp; Jon Flombaum show that the subjective expansion of time happens in our immediate memory, and not in our perceptual experience. In other words, these results suggest that our experience of time does not change in different situations. Instead, the way we remember how long those situations lasted for is distorted. I am looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this!

I am excited to share my research on how space and time dissociate in the construction of a visual moment. This work - in collaboration with Ian Phillips and my advisor Jon Flombaum - suggests that a moment in our visual experience is a snapshot that is stitched together from different moments in time across the visual field. I am looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this!
