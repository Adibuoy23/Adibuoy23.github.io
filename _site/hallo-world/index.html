<p>I’m trying something new, shifting from vanilla <a href="https://html5up.net/">html5up</a> to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. This helps in a few areas: one is dynamic content updates, with the static blog-like format that Jekyll provides, along with a greater usage of markdown in the whole rendering process. My apologies if the website is less user-friendly for a while until I get all the kinks sorted out.</p>
